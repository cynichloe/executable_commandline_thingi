# executable_commandline_thingi

to install the executable, run under root `python3 setup.py develop`, this will create an executable called `Fangi` which can be executed by calling `fangi [commands]`

The 2 commands available at the moment are described in the `click_group.py`: 
1. `hello`
2. `goodbye`

So, the following 2 commands are supported:
1. `fangi hello`
2. `fangi goodbye`
